# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

## Issue Fixed âœ…

The deployment error was caused by a webpack configuration conflict in `next.config.mjs` that was interfering with Tailwind CSS processing.

### Error Message:
```
Module parse failed: Unexpected character '@' (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type
> @tailwind base;
```

### Solution:
Removed the custom webpack CSS loader configuration that was conflicting with Next.js's built-in CSS handling.

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fixed deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository: `Karansd44/KaranSD`
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

3. **Your site will be live at:**
   - `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Node version: 18 or higher

2. **Deploy:**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use the build settings above
   - Click "Deploy site"

### Option 3: Deploy to Your Own Server

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- âœ… `next.config.mjs` is properly configured (fixed!)
- âœ… All images are in the `/public` folder
- âœ… Environment variables are set (if any)
- âœ… Package.json has all dependencies
- âœ… No build errors locally

## Test Local Build

Before deploying, test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Test the production build
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

If the local build works, deployment should work too!

## Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: CSS Not Loading
**Solution:** âœ… Fixed! Removed webpack CSS configuration.

### Issue 2: Images Not Showing
**Solution:** Ensure all images are in `/public` folder and referenced correctly:
```javascript
bgImage: "/work-1.png"  // Correct
bgImage: "./work-1.png" // Wrong
```

### Issue 3: Module Not Found
**Solution:** Install missing dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Issue 4: Build Timeout
**Solution:** Increase build timeout in deployment settings or optimize images.

## Environment Variables

If you need environment variables for your deployment:

1. **Create `.env.local` file:**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url
   ```

2. **Add to Vercel/Netlify:**
   - Go to project settings
   - Add environment variables
   - Redeploy

## Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Test all features:**
   - Navigation
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Chatbot functionality
   - Project links
   - Contact form

2. **Check responsiveness:**
   - Test on mobile
   - Test on tablet
   - Test on desktop

3. **Monitor performance:**
   - Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
   - Check load times
   - Verify SEO scores

## Deployment Commands Quick Reference
